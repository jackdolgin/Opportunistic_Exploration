<h3>What are we trying to learn in this research?</h3>
<p>When deciding where to go out to lunch or what toothpaste to buy, do you try something new or stick with the tried and true? Deciding between things we know about and that which we don't is a conundrum we all face. This oftentimes is referred to as the explore-exploit dilemma and what features we take into account when making this type of decision is still unclear. Specifically, the purpose of this research was to better understand how effort costs are weighed when making decisions about when to explore and when to exploit different options.</p>

<h3>Why is this important to scientists or the general public?</h3>
<p>These questions are of theoretical importance to further our understanding of the role of effort in understanding behavior, particularly information-seeking behavior. We hope to expand our understanding of how people choose to exert or avoid exerting mental effort.</p>

<h3>What are our hypothesis and predictions?</h3>
<p>We believe that the effort costs associated with different lines of action can be leveraged to opportunistically explore when the effort costs (i.e., the difficulty of math problems) of doing so are reduced. If effort costs are used to strategically explore different options, we would expect participants to select the alternate, lesser-known option when the costs of doing so are reduced.</p>

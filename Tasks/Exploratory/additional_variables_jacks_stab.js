    "Welcome to the experiment!<br><br> The instructions are somewhat lengthy, but they're also necessary to do the task well, and we've built the amount of time they take into the full hour that you'll receive credit for.<br><br>Press <b>next</b> or <b>spacebar</b> to continue.<br><br>",
    "Today's experiment will be one of point maximization. Throughout, you'll see two columns of what are essentially slot machines. Slot machines are variable, but in this case we've rigged them so each have an average value of how much reward they yield, and we've also added variability so they might not yield that average amount of reward every time you pull their lever. Each time you pull a slot machine, you'll amass between 1-100 points.",
    "To maximize points, which is the ultimate goal, you'll want to choose which of the two slot machines will give you the most reward. You'll be able to sample each of the two slot machines, but you'll only have a limited number of slot machine pulls, so you'll have to make due with limited information without potentially ever fully knowing the underlying point average of each slot machine.",
    "Let's practice! On the next screen, you'll have seven pulls. Use the F key to sample the left slot machine for any one of those 8 pulls, or the J key to sample the right slot machine.",
    "Great! The double XX's you saw were to further reinforce that for each pull you'll get information about one slot machine, but not the other one. You don't know what you don't attempt to pull, so to speak!",
    "Just to further illustrate, this is what the actual underlying values had all been had you been able to see beneath the double XX's. And just for reference, the true averages for each of the two slot machines were __ for the left one and __ for the right one.<br><br>You won't ever know what the true averages are when you do the main part of the task, but you can clearly see that there's both variability and an overall range for each slot machine, and that they're different!",
    "What you saw is going to be the general setup for the rest of the task, but there's just going to be a few wrinkles, which we'll tell you about now.<br><br>First of all, the first four lever pulls will not be a free choice, but rather a forced choice. So we'll basically control which information you're exposed to in the first four pulls, and therefore that reward won't factor into how much reward you get in the end (we're going to give the top 7 point earners each a $15 gift card on top of participation credit, but again these four first forced trials won't count towards that total).",
    "After those four forced choices, you will have either 1 or 4 lever pulls, for which you are free to choose however you wish.",
    "Let's practice! For the forced choices, the box of one of the two machines will turn green, cueing you to pull that lever. It'll disappear after the four forced choices.",
    "Well done! Another one of the wrinkles is how you select a lever to pull. So far, you've just pressed either F or J. That'll stay true for the forced choices. But for the remaining pulls, you'll have to complete either an addition or multiplication problem as a proxy for pressing F or J.",
    "To get a gist for the math problems, you'll see 10 problems one-by-one. Please, please don't use a calculator! We've gone to lengths to make the experiment's length last less than an hour, and that includes budgeting time to think through the math problems.",
    "When you see the math problems in the context of the slot machines, you won't get a second chance to correctly answer an incorrect response, and that means you simply will see double XX's for both slot machines, like so:",
    "Just as before--when you only needed to press the F and J keys--now solving a problem with multiplication will be the equivalent of using the F key, and addition the equivalent of the J key. So you will always be presented with two numbers, and it'll be up to you whether you want to add those numbers or multiply them. You can type your answer in the box below the numbers, and then we'll automatically check whether your response was for an addition or multiplication problem.",
    "That's all there is to it! Each one of these iterations of 5 or 8 machine pulls we can call a 'game.' You'll complete ___ games during the study, which should last less than ___ minutes.<br><br>Critically, the average value of each slot machine is both unrelated to the other one during the same game, as well as to all future slot machines on either side. So while solving with multiplication will always act on the left slot machine, the left slot machineâ€™s average value in one game is completely unrelated to the average value of the machine on that same (or the other) side during the next game (same goes for the right side machines).",
    "And again, to encourage you to amass many points, those with the top-7 most points earned will win a $15 Amazon gift card, in addition to receiving study participation credit. Press space to begin!"

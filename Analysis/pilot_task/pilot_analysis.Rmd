# Individual Differences {-}

##  Multiplication Accuracy {-}

You can tell here that there was quite a range in terms of how people fared in terms of multiplication accuracy during the task. The following analyses don't exclude any participants if their overall multiplication accuracy was below a certain value, but perhaps we should decide on such a floor, since I wonder how much of bad accuracy is a reflection of ability vs. effort.

```{r plot1}
pilot_data %>%
  group_by(Sub_ID) %>%
  filter(Task == "Multiplication") %>%
  summarise(Performance = mean(Accuracy),
            Response_Time = mean(RT)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(Response_Time, Performance)) +
  geom_point(size = .5) +
  labs(title = paste("Individual Differences in Addition and Response Time",
                     "on Multiplication Problems"),
       caption = paste(n_distinct(pilot_data$Sub_ID), "participants"),
       x = "Response Time (seconds)",
       y = "Accuracy (as a percent of all mult. problems)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

----

## Predictors {-}

### Relationship between Addition and Multiplication Response Times {-}

This data is filtered just for correct trials, and it shows that while people were certainly faster for addition problems than multiplication problems, there was also a pretty close relationship between how fast someone was for addition as they were for multiplication.

```{r plot2}
d <- pilot_data %>%
  filter(Accuracy == 100) %>%
  group_by(Task, Sub_ID) %>%
  summarise(RT = mean(RT, na.rm = FALSE))

ggplot(d, aes(x = Task, y = RT)) +
  intra_diffs("Addition", "#0072B2", -.28, -1, "l") +
  intra_diffs("Multiplication", "#D55E00", .18, 1, "r") +
  geom_line(aes(group = Sub_ID), color = 'lightgray', alpha = .3) +
  labs(title = paste("Individual Differences in Correct Response Times for",
                     "Addition and Multiplication"),
       x = "Math Type",
       y = "Average Response Time (seconds)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

### How Well Multiplication Problems Predict Response Time on the Other Multiplication Problems {-}

The idea of this plot is to see whether we can predict an individual's response time for most correct multiplication problems as a function of only a sampling of correct multiplication problems. The brightest colors show that the snippet that is most predictive of all the other multiplication problems is if we look at response times to the problems that, averaged across all participants, were in the 85th-95th percentile of easiness (so pretty difficult problems). The x-axis is the lowest percentile multiplication problem in the snippet, and the y-axis is how many multiplication problems should compose this snippet. It's also worth noting that increasing a snippet's span (i.e. at larger y values) doesn't necessarily lead to it more accurately predicting the rest of the multiplication problems' response times, and if anything is detrimental to the predictions. That's not to say that more trials in a sample leads to worse predictions, but just that when adding more trials means widening the scope of how difficult the problems in the sample were, the predictions might be more diluted.

### Homing in on a High-Fidelity Multiplication Predicting Snippet{-}

Now that we know which multiplication problems best predict the other ones, we can zoom in on this correlation. Clearly there is a tight correlation between an individual's average response time for correct multiplication problems that are vs. are not in the 85-95th range of easiness. Only participants who had at least 3 correct trials in the snippet were included.

```{r, plot4}
pilot_data %>%
  filter(Task == "Multiplication", Accuracy == 100) %>%
  group_by(Low_Num, High_Num) %>%
  mutate(Combo_RT_mean = mean(RT)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(df_rank_percentile = percent_rank(Combo_RT_mean)) %>%
  group_by(Sub_ID,
           sweetspot = df_rank_percentile >= .85 & df_rank_percentile < .95) %>%
  summarise(across(RT, mean),
            total = n() ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  filter(total >= 3) %>%
  group_by(Sub_ID) %>%
  filter(n() > 1) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(-total) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = sweetspot, values_from = RT) %>%
  magrittr::set_names(c("Sub_ID", "Full", "Sample")) %>%

           # position = position_nudge(y = RT),
           show.legend = FALSE) +
  labs(title = paste("How well the 85th-95th Easiest Multiplication Prbolems",
                     "Predict Response Time on the Other Problems"),

### How Well Addition Problems Predict Response Time on Multiplication Problems {-}

This plot has the same logic to it as the other Northern-Lights-esque plot just above, except this time the multiplication snippets are actually predicting addition response times, not fellow multiplication problems. The area that's most predictive in the plot above is almost the same as in this plot, but the predictions in this plot are (perhaps unsurprisingly) more muted.

# Trends Across Participants {-}

## Relationships b/w Dependent Vs {-}

### Scatterplot of Trial-by-Trial Relationship between Difficulty Rating and Response Time {-}

Only correct trials are plotted, and even though most of the trials last less than 10 seconds, there is certainly some variability, almost all of which is driven by multiplication problems.

```{r plot8}
correct_pilot_data <- filter(pilot_data, Accuracy == 100) 

plotter("correct_pilot_data", "RT", "Difficulty", "Response Time",
        "Rated Difficulty", 0, 75, 0, 110, 10, 0, 100, 10,
        list(geom_point(size = .4))) +
  labs(caption = paste("Each of the",
                       nrow(correct_pilot_data),

                       "participant\n(filtered for trials with RT > 75)"))
```

## Notable Diffs b/w Numbr Cmbos {-}

### No Clear Inflection Point for Multiplication Difficulty {-}

When the difference between multiplication and addition response time among correct problems is plotted along the x axis, in ascending order, the 50% on the right vary more than the 50% on the left, suggesting that the distribution is skewed but not seemingly binary. The orange indicates how much change there is in RT moving one unit along the x axis, underscoring that there is more change further along right but the lack of as much change near the middle of the graph points to a relatively continuous distribution at least most of the way going from left to right. The top plot just transforms the bottom graph so that each step in that 'histogram' is moving one second in response time. So a high and wide-spanning step means that there are a lot of number combinations whose multiplication minus addition RT difference is all within a second of each other. More change in this RT difference from one combination to the next leads to shorter and narrower steps.

```{r, plot10}
plot_10_data <- pilot_data %>%
  filter(Accuracy == 100) %>%
  group_by(Low_Num, High_Num, Task) %>%
  summarise(across(RT, mean)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(across(RT, ~. - lag(.))) %>%
  filter(Task == "Multiplication") %>%
  arrange(RT) %>%
  mutate(Change = lead(RT) - RT,
         row_rank = 100 * row_number() / n())

### Most important graphs {-}

We've already discussed the last two graphs plenty, so I'll just leave them below without saying anything more.

```{r, plot11}
list(
  "pilot_data_high_nums",
  "High_Num",
  c("Accuracy", "RT", "Difficulty"),
  "Largest Addend or Multiplicand",
  c("Accuracy (%)", "Response Time (seconds)", "Rated Difficulty"),
  0,
  25,
  c(65, 0, 0),
  c(100, 15, 50),
  50,
  c(60, 0, 0),
  c(100, 15, 50),
  c(10, 3, 10),
  list(
    list(geom_line(size = 1), geom_point(size = 2))
  )
) %>%
  pmap(plotter) %>%
  reduce(`+`) +
  plot_layout(guides = 'collect') +
  plot_annotation(title = "Averages for Largest Addend and Multiplicand",
                  subtitle = paste("Each value is collapsed across",
                                  n_distinct(pilot_data$Sub_ID),
                                  "participants\n"))
```

		Please consider this information carefully before deciding whether to participate in this research.

	<p>
	The purpose of this study is to examine which factors influence learning and decision making. If you agree to participate, you will be asked to read instructions, and perform certain tasks, such as making decisions between different actions, or learning about how to respond to different pictures. At the end of the study, we will explain which questions motivate this line of research, and describe the potential implications. The study will take approximately 60 minutes to complete, and you will receive 1 credit hours.

	We do not anticipate any risks associated with participating in this study. The effects of participating should be similar to those you would experience from viewing a computer screen and using a mouse or keyboard for a comparable amount of time. The study also will not provide any benefit to you individually. However, it will provide insights about learning and decision making, which has potential implications for public domains such as policy about health care.	<p>
	We will keep any of the information you provide confidential by encrypting and password-protecting the data. If we write a report or article based on your data, we will not include any information that could identify you. Also, all analyses of the data will be averaged across all the people taking part, so your individual data will never be individually analyzed. The journals that publish these reports or articles require that we share your information that was collected for this study with others to make sure the results of this study are correct and help develop new ideas for research. Your information will be shared in a way that cannot directly identify you.

		Your participation in this study is completely voluntary. You may choose to not participate at all, and you may also choose to withdraw at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are entitled. We may be interested in re-contacting you for participation in a follow-up experiment, which would be completely optional and compensated appropriately.	</p>

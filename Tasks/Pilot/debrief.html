<h3>What are we trying to learn in this research?</h3>
<p>Cognitive control, which involves flexibly directing attention toward stimuli that are relevant to one's goals while ignoring irrelevant information, is believed to govern performance on a variety of tasks including those such as Stroop color-naming, flanker tasks, task switching, and prospective memory. Importantly, the flexible adjustment of attention is believed to be cognitively effortful. When reward is equivalent, people tend to make decisions that limit their amount of effortful cognitive exertion. The purpose of this research was to better understand cognitive control processes and how they affect subsequent decisions about what stimuli are experienced.</p>

<h3>Why is this important to scientists or the general public?</h3>
<p>These questions are of theoretical importance to further our understanding of cognitive control processes and are also important for understanding populations with cognitive control deficits (e.g., Schizophrenia) and tasks requiring cognitive control (e.g., driving). We also hope to expand our understanding of how people choose to exert or avoid exerting mental effort.</p>

<h3>What are our hypothesis and predictions?</h3>
<p>We believe that a distinction between proactive and reactive cognitive control may be important in formulating predictions. Proactive control refers to shifts in attention that occur in advance of what you are paying attention to (e.g., in response to a cue that allows you to prepare for an upcoming distractor), and reactive control refers to a shifts that occur post-stimulus onset (that is, after a distraction occurs). Humans likely use both (Braver, Gray, & Burgess, 2007), though it currently unclear what governs selection of one type over another and the degree to which each type of control is effortful. If reactive adjustments to attention are effortful, we would expect participants to more often select stimuli that were less effortful.</p>
